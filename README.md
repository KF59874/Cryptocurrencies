# Cryptocurrencies

## Technologies used - Unsupervised Machine Learning using Python

## Background
Analysis is being conducted on cryptocurrency to guide *Accountability Accounting*, an investment bank, with their decision of including cryptocurrency in their portfolio. A report has been created which includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

## Purpose 
The purpose for this assignment was to learn more about unsupervised machine learning. Models used within this challenge included PCA and K-Means. The data was cleaned, scaled to fit the models and then visualized. 

## Visualization
The data has been clustered in 4 classes, and was represented using a 3D model. Elbow curve calculations were performed to choose the most ideal k-value for the K-Mean model.

A scatter plot has also been created to visualize how many coins have been mined and what the supply for coins is in total:
